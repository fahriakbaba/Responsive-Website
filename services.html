          <h4>website design</h4>
          <p>
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on
            the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of
            website development rather than software development. Web design
            used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers;
            however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers
            has become ever-increasingly important.

          <h4>website maintenance</h4>
          <p>
            Website maintenance is the process of keeping a website up-to-date
            and running smoothly as well as performing optimally. Website
            maintenance includes tasks like ensuring all the links on your site
            are working, regularly updating content, and fixing any broken
            links. It also involves more general housekeeping tasks like backing
            up your site regularly and monitoring your site's performance.

          <h4>website hoisting</h4>
          <p>
            When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a
            website to store its files, they are hosting a website. Web hosting
            makes the files that comprise a website (code, images, etc.)
            available for viewing online. Every website youâ€™ve ever visited is
            hosted on a server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of space allocated on a server to a website depends on
            the type of hosting. The main types of hosting are shared,
            dedicated, VPS and reseller. They are differentiated by the kind of
            technology used for the server, the level of management provided and
            the additional services on offer.
